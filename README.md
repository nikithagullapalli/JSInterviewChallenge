# JSInterviewChallenge

Welcome to the JS code challenge. Below is a set of instructions that you must attempt to complete within 3 days (please return on Monday, May 7). Good luck :)

Your challenge, should you choose to accept it, is to create a web application using any framework you choose. It must be a JavaScript framework and it must follow the user story below.

As a user, I would like to have an application that shows a table of information. 
When the user loads the page, they should see a table presented. 
The application should return data from http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts 
When the user clicks on the header of a table column, it should sort the table. 

We will be looking for
